# 🎊 Injozi front-end challenge 🎊

Here is my iteration of the front end challenge

## objectives ✔️

1)Had to make an api request to http://ergast.com/mrd/ to collect F1 information and parse it into a list on a webpage ✔️

2)Must be setup in a docker container ✔️

3)Selecting a year must show all the drivers of that season ✔️

4)Simple Ui that is responsive ✔️

5)Single page application ✔️

6)Highlight the row of the champion that won that season ❎
(90% complete but am sticking true to the 48 hour rule , also so i can get started on the backend challenge 👀)



## setup instructions 🧰
cd // into the directory where the docker file is //
docker build -t injozi-challenge-frontend .    
docker run -p 3000:3000 injozi-challenge-frontend

simply run the docker container on port 3000 and npm run start
then head over to your local browser and head to this url http://localhost:3000/

## notes
Used variations of tailwind, material ui and styled-components to show my knowledge and understanding of front-end

## conclusion 
This was a pretty fun and engaging challenge, as im writing this im starting the backend challenge 😆
